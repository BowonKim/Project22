                    <p>Hi, I'm Bowon Kim and I'm from South Korea. I am a senior and will graduate this summer at
                        Minnesota State University, Mankato.
                        I am majoring in Computer Information Technology and minoring in Graphic Design. I am planning
                        to go
                        back to Korea with my cat, Winnie after graduation.</p>

            <div class="background container" id="background">

                <div class="text">

                    <p>
                        I grew up in South Korea and I came to the United States to study English and experience other
                        worlds. Since I was young, I liked to do something with the computer so I decided to major in
                        computer information technology however during the three years of college, I could not find any
                        fields that want to study more deeply and work in the specific field. I focused on studying and
                        getting good grades without participating in any activities because I didn't know what I want to
                        do.
                        Then, while taking the graphic design and web design courses last semester, I came across web
                        development for the first time. While developing the website for the project, it was really
                        interesting that I could see the results visually right away. I thought it was a perfect field
                        that
                        combines design and coding that I love and I could find what I want to do after graduation.
                        After
                        deciding what I want to do, I'm studying to improve my skills these days.</p>
